# UFOs

## Goals
I was asked to create a table of all the UFO sightings recorded.  This table needs to have filters based on the data, city, state, country and shape so the viewer can quickly get the info they are looking for. 

## How
Utilizing d3, I created tags in the HTML to connext with the "app" file which is javascript.  Whenever the filter button is clicked, the code will determine which filters were changed and only show the information requested using the .filter method.  If no filters were changed then it will show all data.
